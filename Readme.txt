This program uses a model view controller template with a factory class to create view screens. The footprint, user, and bottle classes are all part of the model and appear on almost every screen. The user class and its associated footprint are passes back and forth between screens and the bottle is updated on each screen based on the userâ€™s footprint. The control is a a screen driver and a card driver which contain action listeners for the next and previous buttons and move the user back and forth between the screen. The screen views are created in a factory.
